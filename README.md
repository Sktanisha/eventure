# Eventure: A quest to organise an inclusive event

Organising a research event can often feel like a quest. You have to journey to venues, overcome monstrous challenges, and eventually return to your normal life. And then someone asks you if you've thought about inclusion.

Eventure is a piece of interactive fiction that takes you, the ~event organiser~ eventurer, on a journey to run the best event you can, levelling up your knowledge on the best practice for inclusive events.

## Are you...
 
- organising a new community event: a conference/unconference, hackathon, seminar, workshop?
- contributing to a recurring event, and hoping to increase inclusivity?
- an experienced organiser, and are hoping to share your knowledge/experience?
- a researcher/enthusiast in inclusivity and diversity hoping to improve the way that information is shared/consumed in this field?

## Why interactive fiction?

Interactive fiction is a very inclusive storytelling medium because it often places the reader themselves in the position of a gender- and race-neutral protagonist, and can be enjoyed at the reader's own place. Plus we just really liked the idea of creating a resource that presented information in a different way from the great guidance already out there.
