### How to create your own eventure

1. [Download and run the Twine software](https://twinery.org/) (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) or use the [online version](https://twinery.org/2)
2. Fork the eventure repository on GitHub
3. Use Twine's "Import From File" function to import the template.html eventure story file
4. Edit the template story in Twine and choose "Publish to File" to save your eventure
5. Upload your eventure .html file to your website, or publish using GitHub Pages
6. (Optional) Tell us about your eventure! 

### Resolving conflicts

We currently use the HTML Twine format for our eventures. This format may
create challenges for git-based merges, in which case we suggest using the
[tweego]() program to:

1. Convert conflicting HTML files to twee format,
2. Merge the twee files (resolving conflicts with a text editor if needed),
3. Convert the merged twee file back to HTML
