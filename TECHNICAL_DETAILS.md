### How to create your own eventure

1. [Download and run the Twine software](https://twinery.org/) (available for
   Windows, Mac and Linux) or use the [online version](https://twinery.org/2),
   then choose one of:
    1. Start a fresh eventure!
    3. Start with an existing eventure file: You can either fork the eventure
       repository on GitHub (files are located in the `stories/`) , or just
       download the eventure HTML file that you'd like to edit. Use Twine's
       "Import From File" function to import the eventure file.
4. Edit the story in Twine and choose "Publish to File" to save your eventure
5. Upload your eventure .html file to a static web host, if you don't have a
   preferred choice, you can [publish using GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
6. (Optional) Tell us about your eventure! 

### Resolving conflicts

We currently use the HTML Twine format for our eventures. This format may
create challenges for git-based merges, in which case we suggest using the
[tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) program to:

1. Convert conflicting HTML files to twee format,
2. Merge the twee files (resolving conflicts with a text editor if needed),
3. Convert the merged twee file back to HTML

If a social conflict arises, we encourage respectful discussion! There is no
one right answer, and it's OK to have multiple versions available. Ideally
disagreements will provide a path to understanding and appreciating our
differences and finding a way to accomodate them as part of our broader
mission.
